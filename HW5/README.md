Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

   The most helpful aspect of thinking about design methods for my FocusBot was figuring out what platforms to use for the bot. This was helpful because if we didnt chose the platform for the bot, then we wouldnt know how the backend will operate. When thinking about design methods, it was best for my group to lay the ground for designing our bot first.


2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

   The most diffucult was figuring out what we wanted the bot to do, because the focusbot has functional oriented design. The design of the bot was going to rely on what we planned the bot will do. This was very hard because we had a lot of options between different types of bots to make. Our team what have probably chose a different type of bot to implement, because the bot we are implementing now, FocusBot, has a lot of functionality that takes time to implement.
   

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
(Links to an external site.)

   Other design methods I might want to try again in the future on another project is implementing data oriented design method, and object oriented design method. For data oriented design method, it would be fun to implement another bot that analyzes data to figure out different trends. For object oriented design method, it would also be fun to create another bot that follows object oriented priciples. This kind of bot would be a combination of functional design pattern, and data oriented design pattern. A bot idea would be, a bot that analyzes trends and can do functions with those trends, for example, change a pie graph to a bar graph.

Implementation

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

     The most helpful aspect about implementing our bot project was it helped us get more familar with backend, we used mongoose for API. The most helpful aspect about testing was it helped us see if the bot was communicating with the user, and see which functions were not working correctly. The most helpful aspect with integration was it helped us make the bot better by using the API, Mongoose, to integrate better functions for the bot.
     
     
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

   The most difficult aspect about implementing, testing, and integration in the FocusBot was getting stuff to work, working with the Mongoose was tricky for me because I never used it, but Dewey helped me a lot with understanding it. What I would do differently is decide which methods to use before hand so it will be easier to handle implementing, testing, and integrating.
   
   
3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
 (Links to an external site.)
 
   For implementation, I would like to try using structural programming method by using the using top-down analysis, because with top-down analysis I would be able to break  down the problem of the project into smaller pieces so I can better tackle the problem. For testing, I might want to try using dynamic testing method on a future project because it will allow me to see different inputs from different testers. For integration, I might want to try to use different APIs on future projects.

Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

   The kanban and code review was very helpful especially for a project like this. The most helpful aspect was the break down of work each person in the group needed to do, this helped us a lot because at first we didnt know if we were all techinically skilled in certain things more than others. But the kanban and code review helped us figure out who has the skills to do what.
   
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

   The most difficult about implementing kanban and code review was figuring out how many parts of the bot each person does. Even though the kanban and the code review helped us figure out the technical skills of each person in the group, it was hard to decide how many parts of the bot one person does versus the other, this was solved by implementing the bot and seeing if we had issues or not.
   
3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
 (Links to an external site.)
 
   Software processes or practices I might want to try on future projects are doing more prototyping before implementing the project. Using prototyes helps with visualizing the overall scope of the project, which will help with deciding user roles, and the breakdown of work each person needs to do.

Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

   A couple of design methods I have encountered are data oriented method, and object oriented methods. A couple of implementation methods I have encountered are structural programming method, and functional programming methods. A couple of software processes I have encountered are prototyping, and agile methods. To contrast, for data oriented methods, this design method is best used if the project is focused on data and data analysis. For object oriented methods, it is best used for projects that have a combination of data and functions. For structural programming methods, it is best if used if the project has a big problem that needs breakdown. For, functional programming methods, it is best if used if the project has a majority of fucntions that need to be implemented, for example the bot project. For prototyping, it is best if used on a project that is hard to visualize or has a lot of functions and methods. For agile methods, it is best if used on a project that changes rapidly in requirements due to customers or stakeholders. How most of these methods can be useful together is if you have a huge project that needs to be implemented, for example a company application. For a project of the sort, you can use agile methods, prototyping, structural, and functional programming methods to implement it. These methods would be useful together because company project usually change rapidly due to stakeholder needs, so using agile methods would be useful. Using prototyping would be helpful because it gives you a demo to show to your boss or stakeholders. And finally, using structural and functional programming methods for breaking down the problems that need to be solved, and programming all the different functions the project needs.
