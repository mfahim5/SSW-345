Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

   The most helpful aspect of thinking about design methods for my FocusBot was figuring out what platforms to use for the bot. This was helpful because if we didnt chose the platform for the bot, then we wouldnt know how the backend will operate. When thinking about design methods, it was best for my group to lay the ground for designing our bot first.


2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

   The most diffucult was figuring out what we wanted the bot to do, because the focusbot has functional oriented design. The design of the bot was going to rely on what we planned the bot will do. This was very hard because we had a lot of options between different types of bots to make. Our team what have probably chose a different type of bot to implement, because the bot we are implementing now, FocusBot, has a lot of functionality that takes time to implement.
   

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
(Links to an external site.)

   Other design methods I might want to try again in the future on another project is implementing data oriented design method, and object oriented design method. For data oriented design method, it would be fun to implement another bot that analyzes data to figure out different trends. For object oriented design method, it would also be fun to create another bot that follows object oriented priciples. This kind of bot would be a combination of functional design pattern, and data oriented design pattern. A bot idea would be, a bot that analyzes trends and can do functions with those trends, for example, change a pie graph to a bar graph.

Implementation

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

     The most helpful aspect about implementing our bot project was it helped us get more familar with backend. The most helpful aspect about testing was it helped us see if the bot was communicating with the user, and see which functions were not working correctly. The most helpful aspect with integration was it helped us make the bot better by integrating better functions for the bot.
     
     
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

   The most difficult aspect about implementing, testing, and integration in the FocusBot was getting stuff to work, working with the Mongoose was tricky for me because I never used it, but Dewey helped me a lot with understanding it.

Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
