Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

   The most helpful aspect of thinking about design methods for my FocusBot was figuring out what platforms to use for the bot. This was helpful because if we didnt chose the platform for the bot, then we wouldnt know how the backend will operate. When thinking about design methods, it was best for my group to lay the ground for designing our bot first.


2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

   The most diffucult was figuring out what we wanted the bot to do. The design of the bot was going to rely on what we planned the bot will do. This was very hard because we had a lot of options between different types of bots to make. Our team what have probably chose a different type of bot to implement, because the bot we are implementing now, FocusBot, has a lot of functionality that takes time to implement.

Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
